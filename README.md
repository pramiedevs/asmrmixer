1. Structure and Style
"Design a web page called ASMR Mixer with a layout inspired by YouTube. Include two video players side-by-side that start 'off' (dark screens) until a playlist or video URL is pasted into a text box. Center a logo in the header that says 'ASMR MIXER'. Offer two dark-themed color palettes: one with grey/violet tones and another with cozy reds and oranges. Ensure the page feels modern, immersive, and relaxing to fit the ASMR theme."

2. Functionality
**"Build functionality to allow users to:

Paste a YouTube video or playlist URL into a text box. Use radio buttons to select either 'video' or 'playlist' mode.
Automatically divide a single playlist into two streams, one feeding each video player, or assign different playlists to each player.
Randomize videos within playlists and allow users to shuffle or skip unwanted videos.
Mute ads when detected (to preserve the ASMR experience) but allow users to skip them.
Add advanced mixing controls (e.g., balance, stereo effects) for a customizable listening experience. Include features like playlist saving, shuffling, and trigger-based customization (e.g., tapping, whispers)."**
3. YouTube API and Web Audio API
**"Integrate the YouTube API to:

Load and control playlists or single videos for each player.
Detect ad states to mute videos during ads and unmute once they end.
Provide volume and playback controls through the API.
Additionally, use the Web Audio API to enable mixing effects like balance and stereo adjustments for each video player."**
