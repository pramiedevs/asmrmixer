ASMR Mixer:
The idea is combining two ASMR videos to create a new, unique experience.
Other ideas
Mixing Effects: Allow users to adjust the mix (e.g., balance, stereo effects) for a personalized experience.
Custom Playlist Creation: Let users save their favorite mixes or playlists for easy access later.
Considering adding an option where users can shuffle videos within a playlist or select specific types of ASMR triggers (e.g., tapping, whispers, etc.) to create a customized experience.

The layout needs to be like youtube.com but two screens that start "off/dark" and turn on (but not play) when you paste the url of a playlist on the text box above. 
It needs to have a logo on the header centered that says ASMR MIXER
It will have 2 color pallets, both kinda dark, but one grey/violet and the other more cozy, with reds and organges, but still darker.
